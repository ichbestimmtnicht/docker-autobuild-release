# Preset global variables from hub.docker.com

# SOURCE_BRANCH: the name of the branch or the tag that is currently being tested.
# SOURCE_COMMIT: the SHA1 hash of the commit being tested.
# COMMIT_MSG: the message from the commit being tested and built.
# DOCKER_REPO: the name of the Docker repository being built.
# DOCKERFILE_PATH: the dockerfile currently being built. 
# As you can not change the Dockerfile for a custom build (using the hooks folder)
# this variable is pointless to use.
# DOCKER_TAG: the Docker repository tag being built.
# IMAGE_NAME: the name and tag of the Docker repository being built. 
# (IMAGE_NAME is a combination of DOCKER_REPO:DOCKER_TAG)

# Reminder:
# You can not use hyphens (-) in bash variables
